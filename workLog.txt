10/30: (didn't start yesterday because I really needed a break)

I'm looking at the instructions for the lab. I'll note things as I go and make a brief list and the end. I'll come up with a design after that, if I can right away.

All three schedulers use Round Robin, so I'd better make sure I know what Round Robin is.
	It's also fairly obvious that threading will be involved.



All schedulers:

"Running round robin in the third queue [in MFQS] means ignoring new arivals in the first queue while the third queue time quantum is not yet over."
        That means, while one process is going, new processes are stuck waiting until the current process is done running.
How can we do this...
	I think I should have the ready/run/wait "ecosystem" in mind.
		Note: If a process is in the running state, I/O puts it in the waiting state, clock interupts put it in the ready state.
			clock interupt during "i++" is bad.

Pseudocode (may or may not be complete):

        Scheduler:

		while(the program is still running){ //possibly an infinite loop, "while(1)"
        	        while(there is a process that wants to get scheduled){
				schedule it
			}
			//if we get here, the scheduler doesn't see any moe processes to schedule, yet
			grab the highestpriority process and let it run it's time quantum.
			if(the process completes within its time quantum){
				we don't need it anymore, so eject it from the ecosystem (aka terminate/kill it). this may happen within the process
			} else {
				demote the process and reschedule it
			}
		}

        New Process:

                wait to be called by the scheduler
		once put in a queue by the scheduler, wait there. Aging should occur while in the queue (unless this is the top queue of MFQS or something)
		once called by the queue, run for the duration of your time quantum
		if(done running before time quantum expires){
			this process ends/dies/gets terminated
		} else {
			priority goes down
		}
		go back to waiting in the queue



Multi-level Feedback Queue (instructions):

Looks like a process has at least these variables for scheduling:
	Time Quantum (int?)
	Priority (int)

To implement aging, each procress should probably have a timer that starts once it is sent to a queue.
	We can have a while loop going while the process is still in the queue that checks if a certain amount of time has gone by.
	*Pseudocode: 

		While(process is still in queue){ //if the "process still in queue" part is something like a function call, that's all we'll need

			//In the following check, the idea of having a spareTime variable is to prevent time from being lost while reseting the timer
			//Example: We want to age every 10 clock ticks, so after 12 clock ticks, spareTime = 2
			//Maybe this isn't so bad depending on how much time is lost. Worth thinking about...

			if(waiting timer has counted that a certain amount of time has passed + spareTime){

				//maybe we should stop the timer here (I'm thinking we probably shouldn't)
				priority += priority increase allowed due to aging;
				spareTime = timer - the amount of time that triggers this aging conditional;
				reset the timer, "waitingTimer.reset()" or something
				//if we stop the timer above, we should start it again before exiting
			}
			//if the "process still in queue" thing isn't a function call, there should be something to check if we're in the queue or not around here
			//however, it better not do any blocking. This while loop needs to keep checking for if we need to age process priority.
		}

	END PSEUDOCODE

Need to consider tiebreakers: when two processes are entering a queue at the same time.

1. When the time quantum of a process expires the exact same time a process ages up, the aged process goes first regardless of current priority.
	If we do that, maybe we should set the aged process to have priority of at least 1 more than the time quantum demoted process.
2. If the above isn't a factor, the highest priority process goes first.
3. If priorities are equal, check pid. The lower pid should go first.
4. I wonder if we'll still have a tie at this point. Perhaps the time quantum of the process can help here (lower one first).

Partner just made a repository, so I'll look at what he has before developing more pseudocode.


11/2:

--MEETING START--

Tried compiling partner's old code. There was a warning for comparing a signed and unsigned integer, but adding a cast to int removed that quickly.
	It compiles, but MFQS doesn't work. Partner did a bit more, but it's still off a ways.

Looked at sample exam with partner to work through an MFQS example by hand. He quickly concluded that our current MFQS code doesn't work that way.
	The sample exam MFQS problem has the second queue have double the time quantum of the queue above it. Perhaps we should do that?
	Need to keep looking at our current code first.

--MEETING ENDED-- (partner going to other classes)

Looking at current MFQS code now. There isn't really that much in there (about 40 lines). I see these problems:

1. It keeps going from the highest queue to the lowest queue in that order. I think this should be dynamic, not linear.
2. Aging isn't implemented at all.
3. Arival time appears to be ignored.

And at least a few others, including having major errors past the first queue. We may want to start from scratch since there isn't much anyway.

There are some things I can see though:

-We may not need threads to implement aging. We could just sent info about the clock to all processes in the READY state each time a "process" is handled.
	However, if we can send info from one thread to all other threads, that may be faster.
	Reminder: aging is defined by the user. As a base case though, we should ignore aging (enter "0" to ignore aging).

-We never have processes in the waiting state in MFQS. I guess it makes sense considering MFQS never does I/O. Not sure this means anything though...


--MEETING START-- (partner back from classes)

decided to look closer at the issues with current MFQS code

Added "process added to next queue" output to the else of "if TQ > time remaining". It never shows on the second iteration.

~Partner added output after when a process is added to the next queue to output the contents of the next queue.
The next queue's data is altered in undesirable ways after the first push.

While my patner's debugging his code, I'll think of how to implement aging and handle arrival time.


*****************************************************
Aging (reminder: only occurs in 3rd or later queues):

Questions:
1. Does aging get reset once a process runs? yes
2. Should we decrease age when a process gets promoted, or reset age? reset age

//perhaps we could set a boolean to true when a process enters the third queue that activates aging checks
//I wonder if there's an easy way to tell which process is the oldest... May need to load processes into a list and sort them.
	//worst case scenario: ignore age order, just promote old processes as we pop them off the queue for being old enough.

Add "age" variable to processes; //can probably be done when loading in process data from file (in main)
								 //or we can add the age variable to processes as they come into MFQS so it doesn't waste time in the other schedulers that don't use aging

//this belongs in the time quantum (TQ) check, before reducing time remaining for the current process
if(numQueues >= 3 && there are processes in the third/forth/fifth queue){ //adding "or later" shouldn't be needed assuming a later queue is empty if an earlier queue is also empty

	//we should probably make the following a function/method call. Should do seperate versions in case MFQS aging isn't like WHS aging

	//May need some booleans here to mark if we can't load a next process or go to a next queue because a queue is empty or doesn't exist

	Load the oldest process from the highest queue with a process (up to third queue); //grabbing just any process isn't so good, we want older processes going before newer ones

	while(we're in a queue that has at least one process whose age variable wasn't checked){ //meaning "loop until the last process in the last queue"

		while(we're cycling through processes in this queue){ //we have one process at a time in here
	
			if(timeRemaining < TQ){
				process.age += timeRemaining (of last process); //arrival time is also a factor
			} else {
				process.age += TQ;
			}

			if(age of this process is past the ageLimit set by the user){ //this is a while loop in case the process has to move up multiple times, ex: a 100 burst process ran in the last queue
				process.age = 0;
				move process to the queue above its current queue; //up to the second queue
			}
			(try to) Load the next oldest process in this queue (the one the outter while loop is going through);
		}
		(try to) Go to the next queue;
	}
}

************************************************
Arival Time (this should be for all schedulers):

//Most of what happens so far is fine. However, we shouldn't send all the processes to the scheduler yet, because they technically aren't there yet (when clock = 0).
//I'll make two versions of this.

########################################################################################
Version 1: send all the processes to the scheduler right away regardless of arival time.

In main.cpp: (change nothing)

In scheduler program:

Load in every process with an arrival time of 0 (ignore the rest for now); //can supposedly remove values from the master process list at the same time

Whenever the clock changes (such as after everything else happens after either TQ for MFQS, or after a single clock tick for RTS):

//using "[[]]" for the if statement parenthesis for clarity
if[[FOR MFQS: clock > arival time of the first process in the master process list not loaded in yet
		FOR RTS: if there's a process with arrival time equal to clock //--------------------------------Don't have to check for less than if it checks every clock tick
		ALL SCHEDULERS: && we didn't load everything from the process masterlist yet (should probably have this first)]] {

	MFQS: "pop" processes off the master process list and "push" them into the working process list.
	RTS: Load all processes with arrival times equal to the current clock value somewhere. The process with the highest priority and lowest PID goes first.

}

//Might be simple as that, but I'm not quite sure...

########################################################
Version 2: don't send over all the processes right away.

In main.cpp:

Send all processes with arrival time equal to 0 to the scheduler;
Store the rest of the data somewhere (maybe keeping it in main.cpp is fine?);

if(all processes were sent to scheduler){ //in this case, all processes would have arrival time = 0
	Tell the scheduler that it doesn't need to bother asking if there's a process yet to be loaded
}

In scheduler, at clock change:

if(did not receive signal that all processes were loaded in){
	Send clock data to wherever the rest of the processes are stored, getting ready to load more processes;
}

In the location where the processes are stored:

if(there's a process that hasn't been loaded by the scheduler with arival time less than the clock value just sent by the scheduler){
	while(there is a process with arrival time less than or equal to recieved clock time){
		send this process to the scheduler
	}
}

if(all processes were sent to scheduler){
        Tell the scheduler that it doesn't need to bother asking if there's a process yet to be loaded
}


END PSEUDOCODE

~MFQS works now, minus aging and arrival time, so here's what's left:
	-add aging and arrival time handling to MFQS
	-the whole of RTS
	-the whole of WHS (which will probably be a lot)
	-output:
		-Gantt chart for each scheduling algorithm
		-"the entiresimulation run of any particular algorithm. 
		It is best to output all process characteristics in one clock tick intervals."
		-"Statistics for the average waiting and average turnaround time." (so we'll need some class that does math)

With MFQS just about complete, we started looking at RTS. We've decided we'll probably encapsulate the program in a while loop, then we were done for the day.

--MEETING ENDED--		



11/3:

With RTS up next, it's time for some Pseudocode for it (note: RTS doesn't have aging, nor does it bother with priority):

Questions:
1. Should we worry about priority for "critical processes" since we're doing soft real-time,?

[the following may not be complete yet]

START PSEUDOCODE

save process list sent over by main function as a process masterlist; //I had the idea that we may not need a masterlist for a moment,
																	  //but we'll need some way to override low priority processes being run
																	  //Even with state setting, having a second list we for reordering can be good

pop processes off the masterlist and add them to a sub list until we find a process with arival time > 0; //maybe this should be a function call

int clock = 0;

Process *p = lowest deadline process with lowest PID in the process sublist; 

//make sure this doesn't end early if a process has a very late arrival time. In other words, this should keep going as long as the master and sub lists aren't empty
while(this->hasJobs()){ 

	if(the sub list is not empty) { //if this isn't entered, we have to wait for more processes to be ready (handled in else)

		//first step is to do a clock tick. this involves reducing the time remaining on the current process and increasing clock by 1.
		p->setTimeRemaining(p->getTimeRemaining - 1);
		clock++;
		
		//maybe the following belongs outside this if/else block...
		
		//I think the best next move is to see if there are new processes coming in
		if(first process in the masterlist queue has arrival time <= clock){
			pop processes off the masterlist and add them to the sub list until we find a process with arival time > clock; //same as the function call line above
		}
		
		//next, see if the current process is over
		if(p->getTimeRemaining() == 0){

			load the lowest deadline process whose arrival time is <= clock;
			
		} else if (p->getTimeRemaining() != 0 && we just loaded in a process with a higher priority) { //may not need the left side of the &&
		
			//may need to check priority before doing the following if soft real-time computing requires it.
			reorder processes so that the current process gets pushed back and the new, lower deadline process gets going;
		
		}
		
	} else { //if there's no process currently going, all we can do is increase the clock and check for something to load (although, the load may belong here)
	
		clock++;
		if(first process in the masterlist queue has arrival time <= clock){
			pop processes off the masterlist and add them to the sub list until we find a process with arival time > clock; //same as the function call line above
			
			p = first of the processes just loaded in;
		}
	
	}
}


END PSEUDOCODE


Will likely keep editing the above for the next few days (starting Thursday; need to study for exam first).

~Partner worked on implementing arrival time to MFQS based off of setting process state. Using that old code should help reduce the need to add new code.


11/5:

--MEETING START--

~Partner still working on how arrival time works with MFQS. Looks like he did a thing or two between when I left last time and now.


I'm looking at the test file the professor sent via email recently, and remember we'll have to deal with negative numbers. Looks like there's negative:
	Burst (2nd #) -> eliminate for all schedulers
	Arrival Time (3rd #) -> either set add to it's wait time and set to zero or eliminate for all schedulers <- ask professor
	Deadline (5th/2nd last #) -> eliminate for RTS. ignore otherwise
	
File number order: Pid	Bst	Arr	Pri	Dline	I/O

These weren't negative in the example file, but are worth considering:
	Priority -> WHS only (maybe RTS). schedule or eliminate <- ask
	I/O -> WHS only. probably best to eliminate
	PID -> eliminate/ignore (same with equal PID)

Partner had a thought: what if a really long process goes, and 2+ processes age at once?
	The obvious bit is that prcesses age up one queue when aged enough regardless of anything else (except when there's less than 3 queues).
	What's more important is the order of the processes when multiple pracesses age... 
		Might be a good idea to check the whole queue for aged processes, then order them based on arrival time/remaining age (older processes first)

Note: bursts in the example file don't seem to exceed 100.

We pretty much solved aging. Pseudocode for an aging function that was made earlier has been updated (line 139).

Probably going to have MFQS done before getting into RTS, but I could still work on RTS pseudocode.

~Partner is wondering about if we should output a gantt chart. Could be worthwhile, at least for figuring things out.

--MEETING ENDED--



11/10: (was busy with an Algorithms assignment on the weekend and my ethernet cable plug's tab broke off yesterday)

I'm going to take a crack at implementing RTS based off the pseudocode I made a week ago (line 271).

I can't seem to read my own pseudocode that well right now... so, here's a break down of how RTS works:

Before main loop:
1. Loads lowest deadline process currently available (with lowest PID as a tiebreaker).
[loads other processes with arrival time == 0]

During main loop:
2. If the current process has a deadline greater than it's burst + the clock, it gets kicked out (and another is loaded).
3. Clock tick occurs.
4. Load in processes:
	a. If the current process isn't done yet,
		i. and another process comes in with an earlier deadline, the new process takes over.
		ii. If no new processes get loaded with a deadline earlier than the current process, just store them, letting the current process continue.
	b. If the current process is done, terminate it and replace it with the next earliest deadline process.

Used the pseudocode and the breakdown to put skeleton code into RTS.cpp



11/13: Both of us are working from home today. We're communicating through email.

~Partner made a constructor for a queue data structure made for MFQS so that it doesn't need a time quantum.
	I can probably use this to make a seperate queue for my idea to implement RTS. Howeverm it doesn't look like a priority queue...

I found that C++ has a priority queue data structure built in. Perhaps I can put processes in there and sort by deadline.
	Info from http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/priority_queue

So right now, my objective is to see if a C++ priority queue can sort processes by deadline.
	I may need my own test file and need to include <queue> for the queue, and <functional> and <vector> as well.

I replicated the results I saw from example code for a C++ priority queue, now I need to try it with processes.
	But I'm wondering how processes get loaded into a class...
		Apparently, the processes are there by default since it's sent to the Scheduler interface, which becomes a certain scheduler.
